    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will go through a series of steps that will let you\n",
    "discover functionalities of the `GaussianCopula` model, including how\n",
    "to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create an instance of a `GaussianCopula`.\n",
    "-   Fit the instance to your data.\n",
    "-   Generate synthetic versions of your data.\n",
    "-   Use `GaussianCopula` to anonymize PII information.\n",
    "-   Customize the data transformations to improve the learning process.\n",
    "-   Specify the column distributions to improve the output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is GaussianCopula?\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sdv.tabular.GaussianCopula` model is based on [copula\n",
    "funtions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, a *copula* is a distribution over the unit cube\n",
    "${\\displaystyle [0,1]^{d}}$ which is constructed from a multivariate\n",
    "normal distribution over ${\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{d}}$ by using the\n",
    "probability integral transform. Intuitively, a *copula* is a\n",
    "mathematical function that allows us to describe the joint distribution\n",
    "of multiple random variables by analyzing the dependencies between their\n",
    "marginal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s now discover how to learn a dataset and later on generate\n",
    "synthetic data with the same format and statistical properties by using\n",
    "the `GaussianCopula` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Usage\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading one of our demo datasets, the\n",
    "`student_placements`, which contains information about MBA students that\n",
    "applied for placements during the year 2020."

    "that did not contain the student `address`. This happens because the\n",

    "columns that it had to learn afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation, which in this case was very inefficient, happens\n",
    "because the Tabular Models apply [Reversible Data\n",
    "Transforms](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT) under the hood to transform\n",
    "all the non-numerical variables, which the underlying models cannot\n",
    "handle, into numerical representations which they can properly work\n",
    "with. In the case of the `GaussianCopula`, the default transformation is\n",
    "a One-Hot encoding, which can work very well with variables that have a\n",
    "little number of different values, but which is very inefficient in\n",
    "cases where there is a large number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the Tabular Models have an additional argument called\n",
    "`field_transformers` that let you select which transformer to apply to\n",
    "each column. This `field_transformers` argument must be passed as a\n",
    "`dict` which contains the name of the fields for which we want to use a\n",
